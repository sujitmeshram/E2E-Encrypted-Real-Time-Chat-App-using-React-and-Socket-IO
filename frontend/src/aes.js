//file aes.js which is responsible for the encryption
//of outgoing messages and decryption of incoming messages by the use of the same secret key,

var secret_key = "uI2ooxtwHeI6q69PS98fx9SWVGbpQohO";

//In the code above, we imported aes256 from the aes module
// and wrote the functions where the incoming encrypted message is decrypted
//and outgoing message is encrypted.

//Ofcourse the welcome user message is not to be encrypted.
